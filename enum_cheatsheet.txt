## ENUM CHEATSHEET ##

# Passive information gathering

* Useful Google Dorks:

# Active information gathering

host -t <domain>				#-Will give you all related ip's 
host -l <domain> <ns server>	#-Zone transfer

# Scanning

* Network sweeping techniques: 

Ping Scan: 
nmap -sn <IPs>

* Ping Scan over specific ports:
nmap -p 80 <IPs> -oG web.txt

* Scan for large networks: 
nmap -sT --top-ports 20 <IPs> -oG top-ports.txt 

Note: After this scan, you can have a nice idea of the machines you are facing and then scan them on all ports specifically

nmap -sV <IP>  	banner grabbing
nmap -O <IP>	OS fingerprinting
nmap -A <IP>	More rigorous - executes nse scripts 

nmap -A -O <IPs> #-Notice the -A not only does OS enum, but also run nse scripts 
 
* NetBios Scan: 

nbtscan will give us important information around hosts running NetBios and even logged in users

nbtscan <IP>

* SMB Null Session

For this we use rpcclient command 

rpcclient -U “” <IP>

Then you can run commands such as: 

srvinfo
enumdomusers	
getdompwinfo

* Enum4Linux

enum4linux -v <IP>		#-More verbose

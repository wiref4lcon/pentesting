A start frame delimiter (8 bits = 1 octet)
A destination MAC address (48 bits = 6 octets)
A source MAC address (48 bits = 6 octets) 
Length/Type field (16 bits = 2 octets)
Stuff inside the layer 2 frame (remaining 46 to 1500 octets) 
Pad: zeros to fill if needed
Frame Check Sequence or FCS (32 bits = 4 octets)
